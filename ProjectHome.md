SZ-Tetris is the "hard core" of Tetris (only "S" and "Z" tetrominoes are coming, making the problem more challenging). It is used as a reinforcement learning benchmark.

This code was used for experiments in the paper
"SZ-Tetris as a Benchmark for Studying Key Problems of Reinforcement Learning" by I. Szita and Cs. Szepesv√°ri, on the Machine Learning and Games workshop of ICML'10.
